## What is this?

An Xcode File Template that creates an Objective-C Coordinator class. It is for both iOS and OS X. Inspired by a really good reading by Soroush Khanlou ([Github](https://github.com/khanlou), [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/khanlou)) about [Coordinators Redux](http://khanlou.com/2015/10/coordinators-redux/) I created this Xcode file template.


## Xcode Template Ressources

* There is a [very good article](Creating Custom Xcode 4 File Templates) which describes how to create your own Xcode file templates with **lots** of insights about the quite undocumented keys and variables used in the `TemplateInfo.plist`.
